	description = A boarding hatch for the C7's MK1 cabins. Allow crew to board and unboard the craft laterally - interesting when you have no MK1 Crew Cabin with attacment points free. Having no seats, it's strongly recommended to avoid having passengers lingering during the flight. Provides a jump seat for 1 Kerbal with minimal (if any) confort.
