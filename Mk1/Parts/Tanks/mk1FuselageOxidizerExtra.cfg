	description = A standard fuselage that carries oxidizer for spaceplanes, stretched to carry on 22% more volume. Holds oxidizer to counterpart the Mk1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage. It's main (and probably only) purpose is to be used as external oxidizers tanks to small spaceplanes that need to save size and weight for the reentry and/or external boosters for vessels already plenty of fuel.
