	description = A standard fuselage that carries oxidizer for spaceplanes. This one is chock-full of oxidizer. Holds almost enough oxidizer to counterpart the Mk1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage in high pressured containers. You need 10 oxidizers tanks for each 9 Liquid Fuel Tanks (hey, you save one!). Due space and pressure constrains, high tech materials were used leading to increased costs and weight besides being less resistent to shock and temperature. It's main (and probably only) purpose is to be used as external oxidizers tanks to small spaceplanes that need to save size and weight for the reentry and/or external boosters for vessels already plenty of fuel. The lower shock and temperature resistance make it tricky to survive high speeds, G manouvers and atmpspheric reentry. Use with caution and avoid using it on the main fuselage!
