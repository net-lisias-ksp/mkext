## Description

Using inspiration from [Mk-Cabin-Hatch](https://github.com/skalou/Mk1-Cabin-Hatch), blablabla, WiP.



### Parts

	+ Mk1 Boarding Hatch
	+ Some specialized fuel tanks
+ Mk2
	+ Some specialized fuel tanks
+ Mk3
	+ Some specialized fuel tanks


## Known Issues

* Mk1 Cockpit Civilian
	* The Pilot's SelfieCam is out of place (the console is on the way)
	* The cabin's lights are not working. I messed up the GLOW UV mapping somehow.
	* Jump Seat
		* The Jump seat mesh ideally should be a simplified one, not a full featured seat. 
		* The kerbal's eyes view revealed some glitches on the cockpit mesh. I don't remember messing up with the vertices, however - perhaps a legacy mesh error that was never discovered before?
		* That half baked measure to hide the hatch's hole on the fuselage also need some caring...
* Mk1 Boarding Hatch
	* The cabin's lights are not working. I messed up the GLOW UV mapping somehow.
	* Some of my aircrafts are being locked by some reason when I use the Boarding Hatch. But I'm not sure if this is my fault or some mod stomping my feet.
	* The Seat mesh ideally should be a simplified one, not a full featured seat (as it is intended for crew use, as in a real aircraft)
	* The Boarding Hatch meshes need some work too.
		* The external hatch probably should be higher (and bigger?) 
		* The Mask and Overlay are cropping the wrong side
		* Need to get rid of a window in the internal view
			* And add a 90° Hatch	 
* Some of my aircrafts are being locked by some reason when I use the Boarding Hatch and/or Civilian Cockpit. But I'm not sure if this is my fault or some mod stomping my feet.
* Perhaps remove all internal hatch, creating open spaces? We are talking about civilian, atmospheric only, aircrafts after all - no need to be orbit proof.
	* Not sure if it would work with the internal view... 
* Mk1 Oxidizer Tank
	* That "high pressure" stunt didn't cut it. =P
	* Need some better story to justify that 10% extra capacity, or perhaps a better balance for the feature. :-D
